summary: program I wrote in 211 involving csv files, read ins, and manipulation of data.

After several assignments in 211, we tied the section together by combining code from the previous assignments. There is a lot of functionality behind these concepts, and I enjoyed glueing them together. I learned how to read in from files, store them in data structures, manipulate them, and finally output them.
