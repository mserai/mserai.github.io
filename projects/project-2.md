I was teamed with three other students to present on the topic of Giribala, a story by Mahasweta Devi. For this project, I learned how to utilize cuts of YouTube videos and record voice over dialogue to present on the topic. I trimmed each YouTube clip to accompany the topics of designated slides. Once the majority of the PowerPoint presentation was completed, I began to record a voice over of each slide, and incorportated them in a way that would allow the user to listen to them. I learned how to utilize the Snowball iCE by Blue Microphones and learned how to use PowerPoint more in depth.
