summary: Manoa Recipes final project for ICS 314.
---

Manoa Recipes is the Final Project for ICS 314. Our team of 4 worked to create a recipe collection that everyone can enjoy, and for UH student and faculty to contribute to. The process was driven with issue based project management in GitHub. The project included elements of HTML, CSS, Semantic UI and Javascript using Meteor.
