summary: Manoa Recipes final project for ICS 314.
---

For our final project for ICS 314, we developed Manoa Recipes. Our team of 4 worked to create a recipe collection that everyone can enjoy, and for UH student and faculty to contribute to. The process was driven with issue based project management in GitHub and incorporated elements of HTML, CSS, Semantic UI and Javascript with Meteor. Our future goals for this application includes a feature that allows you to set a daily, weekly, or by the meal budget and recipes would be returned that fulfil the requirements. Several options that satisfy dietary restrictions would be made available as well. Another feature that we would want to make available for each recipe would be a comments section, that users would be able leave their impressions in. I would also liked to have been able to create a communities section, where students could sign up to be grouped together and create meals together using the appliances at their disposal, which would also require the need to sort for recipes by appliance. The group would split the costs evenly, that way a meal that would be a cause for celebration (birthday, graduation, thanksgiving, etc.) could be easily attainable.
