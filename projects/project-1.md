I built my last computer in 2009 and it was time for an upgrade. In the spring of 2016 I was able to purchase all the parts that would allow me to create my new system. My girlfriend, Steffany showed interest in the process, so I suggested that she take on the responsibility herself. After a few viewings of YouTube tutorials, I deconstructed my old system to allow her to get familiar with the components. When she became comfortable enough, I talked her through some of the initial steps and then took a backseat as she built my (which is now our) new computer. She was able to configure the storage configuration we wanted and practiced the process of backing up our data.
