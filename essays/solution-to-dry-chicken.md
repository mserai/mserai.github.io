# Who Hates Dry Chicken?

I hate dry chicken. I hate eating it and I hate serving it. It is a very easy ingredient to overcook, as ensuring that the chicken reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit is very important in regards to food safety. But let's not just isolate and shame chicken. Whether you use a grill, an oven, broiler, or stove, cooking chicken perfectly is possible for everyone. Cooking in general requires consistancy, integrity, and attention to details. Luckily, we subscribe to the method of developing and sharing recipes to standardize cooking procedures and using the proper measurements of complimentary ingredients. By searching for the perfect recipe and following their instructions, the cook limits the variability of the intended final product. What will be left after the procedure reflects upon your own personal preference. Either you will find that the recipe was perfect for you, or it was missing some element in it, or it was just not for you. Once you find the perfect recipe for you however, you will have found your new standard method of preparation when it comes to those collections of ingredients. That recipe will be one of your solutions to creating a great home cooked meal.
