# Problem 1:

  My first problem occured when the extracting of Meteor tool 1.5.2.1 took several hours without completing. I googled the issue I was having, but initially could not figure out what the posts meant. I began sending direct messages asking for help, which led me to instructions that still did not help. I reinstalled Meteor, git, 7z, turned off Windows Defender, etc. in hopes that that would help my extracting issue, as each iteration burned through several hours. I was about to give up, and begin some other assignments when I stumbled upon a set of instructions I did not try in the order in which was given. It still did not produce immediate results. I left the install running and went out for lunch. Between 2 and a half to three hours later, I went back home to find that the extraction had finished. I firmly believe that my last attempt at fixing the situation made a difference, and not just allowing the extraction to run its course, as I had left it running overnight a few days before. I contacted the TA to notify him that my issue had been resolved, in order to try and better help others with my issue. When I look back at it, I probably should have sent the information to the whole class, as to prevent the TA from having to play the role of the man in the middle. After completing the first WOD(Workout of the Day), I started the same instance under a different file to assure that the fix to the issue could be replicated. It finished in around 3 minutes, and I felt confident that the information I had passed on could help those with the same problem as I did. 
  
# Problem 2:
  
 My second issue with Meteor so far consists of its Windows version. The general consensus suggests that I either create a Linux partition on my laptop, install a VM, or replace Windows with Linux all together. I feel as though I have missed this opportunity already, as setting everything up to date with where we are in the coursework would take quite a bit of time. I have another laptop, but it is not a developer quality laptop. I could purchase another laptop, but I have had to cut down hours at work which would make things tight financially. I am unfamiliar with the methods of obtaining a Linux box and would hate to mess something up along the way, and break the Windows laptop. That would be disastrous, and I wouldn't have a means to finish the class. I am still torn on what to do, and guess that I will just have to deal with the Windows version of Meteor.
