# You Git What You Ask For 

After having read "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Raymond, I closed the webpage feeling a mixture of emotions. I felt a little guilty, knowing that I at times have failed to specifically convey what my problems are and should have received the acronyms STFW and RTFM. I also felt proud, because I have asked questions after having exhausted readily available resources in a respectful and courteous manner. However, what I really feel when I walk away from this read is a sense of gratitude for what the author wishes to convey.
