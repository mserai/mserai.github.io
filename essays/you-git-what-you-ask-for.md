# You Git What You Ask For 

After having read "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Raymond, I closed the webpage feeling a mixture of emotions. I felt a little guilty, knowing that I at times have failed to specifically convey what my problems are and should have received the acronyms STFW and RTFM in response. I also felt proud, because I have asked questions in a prepared and courteous manner. However, what I really felt when I walked away from this read is a sense of gratitude for what the author wishes to convey. Highly technical answers sprout from technical questions, and those with the questions who are unfamiliar with the topic should be prepared on how to ask them.

## How To Git What You Want

By all accounts it makes sense to me that someone who is not being paid to specifically answer all forms of questions, would find an annoyance in being asked stupid questions. Every specialty takes time to master, and those unwilling to undergo the grueling process of learning, shouldn't be afforded a bypass to that process. By becoming involved in the topic, those who are able to assist you, become more able to assist you. This doesn't necessarily mean that they will, as those whose interests are being protected in this article have made it evident that even if you abide by all of these courtesies, they still might not be interested in helping you.

By phrasing what you have to ask in the form of a thought-provoking question, you allow for a dialogue that a larger number of people will want to chime in on. [This page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5062614/how-to-decide-when-to-use-node-js) links to a question I found on StackOverFlow that demonstrates some of Eric Raymond's qualities of a smart question.
