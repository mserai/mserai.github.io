# Meteor

   So far, learning to use Meteor is the most complex task I have encountered on my way into becoming a software engineer. Preparation was not enough to help me hurdle over the nuances of this open source platform. Once I thought I had everything set up and was ready to go, I encountered an issue that would not let me even start building my application. The extraction of a tool in Meteor took several hours, and after having sought several solutions to the issue, I was finally able to begin. Configuring this platform to each individual piece of hardware is bound to have bumps along the way, and I certainly lack the prowess of troubleshooting. Finding the exact issue under the exact circumstances for the exact specifications of my hardware's issues is certainly a skill set of a Wizard. One who is able to conjure an exact replication of the issue with all the explicit details in tow. I am no Wizard, I am a Muggle. A Muggle who's invitation to a wizarding school is hidden amongst forums, within answers to specific questions, and within the skill set of a problem solver.

## The Magic of Meteor

   Although it might require some magic to become well versed in Meteor application building, a Muggle like myself can still feel the mystacism that the platform provides. My two weeks of Meteor use have left me in awe. It was a portkey transporting me from one place to another, along with a set of skills (albeit remedial), that jumped my perception of software engineering into another realm. The world I once knew that revolved around writing code that existed only on my laptop, is gone. I feel as though I have been given a wand, but I am not qualified to use it. I envy those who have mastered its potency, yearning to overcome my limitations because I have seen the magic it can produce.

## Becoming a Wizard

  The magic that is Meteor is only as fantastical as its wielder.
