# Meteor

   So far, learning to use Meteor is the most complex task I have encountered on my way into becoming a software engineer. Preparation was not enough to help me hurdle over the nuances of this open source platform. Once I thought I had everything set up and was ready to go, I encountered an issue that would not let me even start building my application. The extraction of a tool in Meteor took several hours, and after having sought several solutions to the issue, I was finally able to begin. Configuring this platform to each individual piece of hardware is bound to have bumps along the way, and I certainly lack the prowess of troubleshooting. Finding the exact issue under the exact circumstances for the exact specifications of my hardware's issues is certainly a skill set of a Wizard. One who is able to conjure an exact replication of the issue with all the explicit details in tow. I am no Wizard, I am a Muggle. A Muggle whose invitation to a wizarding school is hidden amongst forums, within answers to specific questions, and within the skill set of a problem solver.

## The Magic of Meteor

   Although it might require some magic to become well versed in Meteor application building, a Muggle like myself can still feel the mysticism that the platform provides. My two weeks of Meteor use have left me in awe. It was a portkey transporting me from one place to another, along with a set of skills (albeit remedial), that jumped my perception of software engineering into another realm. The world I once knew that revolved around writing code that existed only on my laptop, is gone. I feel as though I have been given a wand, but I am not qualified to use it. I envy those who have mastered its potency, yearning to overcome my limitations because I have seen the magic it can produce.

## Becoming a Wizard

  The magic that is Meteor is only as fantastical as the ability of the wielder. My experience with HTML over the past few weeks defined what I was able to accomplish with Meteor. After all, Meteor harnesses HTML. Writing the HTML and JavaScript was a comfortable experience, as writing code is what I have been doing for a few years. What I found to be complicated was ensuring that the proper versions of the packages and applications I needed were working together. It wasn't just complication for me. It was a roadblock. The research of a problem only somewhat similar to mine was hard enough, and the lack of experience in replicating my exact problem was the icing on its unforgiving cake. Meteor made me star struck over its greatness but also left me with utmost frustration. 
  
## Yet Still a Muggle

  I eagerly anticipate using Meteor in the future, as it is my first glimpse into a magical world. Yet I need to be able to make it usable for me. The only magic I have learned from Meteor is the ability to create sparks that fizzle and pop, which vanish as easily as I can conjure it. What I need and can see from using Meteor illuminates not only the room, but the world I wish to venture in. Magic that can guide me as far as my imagination is willing to allow.
